This is my solution to HW1

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
# this is a comment
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3

### Data frame and plot

The code chunk below creates a dataframe and generates a plot

```{r plot_example}
library(tidyverse)

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500, mean = 2, sd = 4),
  y = 3 - 4.2 * x + rnorm(500)
)

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```

Plot shows a linear relationship as expected.

The dataframe has `r nrow(plot_df)` rows.

Here is a list:

* This is my first list item
* Lists need 2 items at least
  * This list has a sub-list item
* Third list item

### Table

Col 1 | Col 2
------|-------
a     | b
c     | d
